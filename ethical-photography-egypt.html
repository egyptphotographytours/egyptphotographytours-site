                <p>Egyptian people are incredibly warm and welcoming, but this doesn't mean they're subjects for unrestricted photography. Here's how to approach portrait photography with respect and dignity.</p>

                        <h4>Always Ask First</h4>
                        <p>Never assume permission. Use simple Arabic phrases or gestures to ask. A smile and respectful approach go a long way.</p>

                        <li><strong>Greet respectfully</strong> - Start with "As-salamu alaykum" and a smile</li>
                        <li><strong>Make eye contact</strong> - Show you see them as a person, not a subject</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask clearly</strong> - Use simple phrases or gestures with your camera</li>
                        <li><strong>Respect the answer</strong> - If they say no, thank them and move on</li>
                        <li><strong>Show the photo</strong> - Many people enjoy seeing their picture</li>
                        <li><strong>Offer fair exchange</strong> - Small tip or buying from their shop if appropriate</li>

                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Carry your camera visibly but not intrusively. People are more likely to agree when they see you're a serious photographer, not just snapping randomly.</p>

                            <p><strong>No, it's never okay to photograph people without their consent.</strong> Always ask permission first, using simple Arabic phrases or clear gestures. This shows basic respect for personal dignity and privacy. The only exception might be wide shots of crowds where individuals aren't identifiable, but even then, be mindful of cultural contexts.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>This is common in tourist areas. If you agreed on payment beforehand, honor it. If not, you can politely decline with "La shukran" (no thank you). To avoid this situation, establish expectations clearly before photographing. Consider that for some people, posing for photos is part of their livelihood, so fair compensation is appropriate when you're getting professional-quality portraits.</p>

                            <p>Drone regulations in Egypt are strict. You generally cannot fly drones near archaeological sites, military areas, or airports without special permits. For tourist photography, it's safest to assume drones are prohibited. If you plan to use a drone, research current regulations thoroughly and obtain necessary permits well in advance through official channels.</p>

                            <p>Most Egyptian museums allow photography without flash, but some specific artifacts or galleries may be restricted. Always check signs at each gallery entrance. The Grand Egyptian Museum (opening 2026) will have specific photography guidelines. Some museums charge extra for camera permits (beyond phone photography).</p>

                            <p>Always get permission from parents or guardians first. Never give money directly to children for photos—this can encourage problematic behavior. Instead, consider small gifts with parental approval or supporting community projects. Photograph children in groups or with family members, never in vulnerable situations. Most importantly, treat children with the same dignity and respect you'd want for your own children.</p>
